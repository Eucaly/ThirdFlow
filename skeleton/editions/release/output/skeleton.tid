An additional plugin creation command module makes it easy to create the package plugin itself as well as a demonstration ~TiddlyWiki without the hassle of having to maintain separate and even multiple ``tiddlers/`` and ``plugin/`` folders. Also, the //Third Flow// relieves you from shuffling tiddler source code files around in your source code repository.\n\nThere's only a ''single'' tiddler source code tree and it is synchronized to your tiddler's title-based structure. Thus, no more need for external editing sessions and source file shuffling.\n\nSimply install this plugin into your ~TiddlyWiki in which you are developing your customizations. For more information, please go to the [[Third Flow project website|http://thediveo.github.io/ThirdFlow]].\n\nEnjoy the //Third Flow//!"}}}
