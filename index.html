		  <h2>About <i>Third Flow</i></h2>

          <p>The <i>Third Flow</i> plugin brings to you another way to develop customizations for
          <i class="fa fa-external-link-square "></i>&nbsp;<a href="http://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki&nbsp;5</a>.
          It is not enforcing a specific development flow, it simply tries to help you. Otherwise, it tries to stay
          out of your way.</p>

    	  <p>You can <strong>develop your plugin directly from within your browser</strong>. A server-based
    	  TiddlyWiki instance running on Node.js ensures that all your source tiddlers are neatly stored
    	  in a clean and hierarchically organized folder structure.</p>

    	  <p><strong>Source code management is done as usual</strong> using your favorite source code management tool,
    	  such as git and others. As the <i>Third Flow</i> plugin structures your tiddler source files you get a
    	  well-organized repository structure at no price.</p>

    	  <p>For <strong>packaging your plugin</strong> you finally simply run a shell script which packs the
    	  plugin tiddler and saves it to disk. Additionally, a demonstration TiddlyWiki is also created that
    	  guides your future plugin users through the process of deploying your new plugin. The neat trick here
    	  is that the <i>Third Flow</i> plugin automatically removes itself from your demonstration TiddlyWikis,
    	  because you don't need and want it there.</p>

		  <p>Of course, the <i>Third Flow</i> has been developed using the same process it supports.
