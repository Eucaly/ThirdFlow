		  <h2>About <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span></h2>

		  <img class="left" src="third-flow.png" alt="Third Flow plugin">

          <p>The <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin brings to you another way to develop customization
          <a class="ext" href="http://tiddlywiki.com/#Plugins">plugins</a>
          for <a class="ext" href="http://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki&nbsp;5</a>.
          This plugin is not enforcing a specific development flow, it simply tries to help you when you want it
          to help you. Otherwise, it tries to stay out of your way.</p>
          
		  <p class="clear"></p>

          <h3><span class="fa fa-cubes"></span>Development</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-mid framed right rot-1" style="width: 40%;">
            <img src="third-flow development phase.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Development Phase</figcaption>
          </figure>

    	  <p>You can <strong>develop your plugin directly from within your browser</strong>. A server-based
    	  TiddlyWiki instance running on Node.js ensures that all your source tiddlers are neatly stored
    	  in a clean and hierarchically organized folder structure.</p>

    	  <p><strong>Source code management is done as usual</strong> using your favorite source code management tool,
    	  such as <a class="ext" href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and others. As the <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin structures your tiddler source files you get a
    	  well-organized repository structure at no price.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>

		  <h3><span class="fa fa-send"></span>Release</h3>

          <figure class="taped-left framed right rot2" style="width: 50%;">
            <img src="third-flow release phase.jpg" />
            <figcaption>Release Phase</figcaption>
          </figure>
 
    	  <p>For <strong>packaging your plugin</strong> you finally simply run a shell script which packs the
    	  plugin tiddler and saves it to disk. Additionally, a demonstration TiddlyWiki is also created that
    	  guides your future plugin users through the process of deploying your new plugin.</p>
    	  
    	  <p>The neat trick here is that the <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin automatically
    	  removes itself from your demonstration TiddlyWikis,
    	  because you don't need and want it there.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>

		  <h3>Turtles All the Way Down</h3>

		  <p>Of course, the <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin has been developed using the same
		  process it supports. Eat your own dog food. This one really tastes delicious. Even if you're not a
		  dog &ndash; but luckily, nobody will know on the Internet.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>

          <h2><span class="fa fa-birthday-cake"></span>Developer Tools</h2>
          
          <p>Wait! There's more in our <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin surprise box.
          Well, vi experts won't exactly be thrilled at what we have to offer. But for all us real browser-addicts we've added a
          few nice developer tools that should make your developer life more comfortable
          &ndash; while you are working on your next great TiddlyWiki plugin.</p>
          
          <h3>Find Your Sources</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-left framed right rot-1" style="width: 40%;">
            <img src="third-flow sidebar plugin sources.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Clear View on Your Plugin Code</figcaption>
          </figure>

    	  <p>A new side bar tool gives you a clear overview over the plugin source you that are part of your
    	  plugin development project. The plugin sources view doesn't need any configuration. It simply shows
    	  all plugins which are not part of the core, that is, all inside the <code>$:/plugins</code> branch.
    	  And all this in a neatly way, with your plugins clearly standing out for easy reference.</p>
    	  
    	  <p>As another nice developer feature,
    	  we cut away the irritating long prefixes that otherwise eat up all your valuable screen space.
    	  Compare this with the stock System view, where you end up with a forest of unwieldly long and
    	  hard-to-read prefixes.</p>

          <h3>Easily Organize Your Tiddlers</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-left framed right rot2" style="width: 50%;">
            <img src="third-flow file storage setup tags.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Organize Your Tiddlers by Tag</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>The <span class="plugin nb">ThirdFlow</span> plugin organizes all your tiddlers neatly into
          subfolders ... and you can easily configure it what organization you would like. And we even
          give you a nice control panel tab so you can quickly get up and running. The best of all? You
          don't need to restart the server while you reconfigure: the server automatically picks up your
          configuration.</p>
          
          <h3>By Tag</h3>
          
          <p>For instance, you can easily organize all the tiddlers for documentation and demonstration using
          the new feature "Tag-based Folders": tiddlers with a particular tag all get into their own subfolder (tag folder).
          Sweet, isn't it? You can even choose to use hierarchical subfolders inside these tag folders.</p>

		  <p class="clear"></p>
          
          <h3>Subfolders or Flat?</h3>
          
          <figure class="taped-mid framed right rot-1" style="width: 50%;">
            <img src="third-flow file storage setup basic.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Drafts & SystemS Stuff Well Organized &ndash; and The Rest Anyway</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>There are also the basic setting only a control panel click away: the name of the folder for
          system tiddlers (those pesky titles starting with <code>$:/</code>). Or where to throw your
          drafts into.</p>
          
          <p>Oh, and finally, you can even decide whether you want to store all your other tiddlers either
          simply flat or (based on their titles) into their own hierarchy of folders and subfolders.</p>
