This filter expression (see below for details on its parts) is the test bed for [[save-all-wo-plugin-sources test|$:/plugins/TheDiveO/ThirdFlow/templates/save-all-wo-plugin-sources]]: it returns most the ~TiddlyWiki itself (as with the [[$:/core/save/all]] template), yet with some important exceptions...

# those source tiddlers which are also identically inside a plugin (``[is[shadowinsync]]``)
# the [[ThirdFlow|$:/plugins/TheDiveO/ThirdFlow]] plugin itself, but only if it is not empty (``-[[$:/plugins/TheDiveO/ThirdFlow/readme]is[shadow]removesuffix[/readme]] +[sort[title]]``). This is a special rule that just covers the //Third Flow// plugin: normally, you don't want to include it in your own plugin demo ~TiddlyWiki releases. Therefore, the //Third Flow// plugin gets cloned only once when dumping //Third Flow// demonstration ~TiddlyWiki.
