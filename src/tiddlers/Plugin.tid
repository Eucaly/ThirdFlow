!Abstract

A ''plugin'' in ~TiddlyWiki 5 is a bundle of tiddlers packaged together as a //single// tiddler. Plugins are used to distribute optional customizations components for ~TiddlyWikis.

!Types

Plugins have a `plugin-type` field that currently can take on these values:

* `plugin` (which is the default) indicates a plain plugin; that is, a plugin that isn't further specialized in its purpose.
* `theme` identifies plugins that provide themes and that are understood by ~TiddlyWiki's theming mechanism.

!Technical

From the technical perspective, a plugin is a single tiddler with [[JSON]] content. This JSON content in turn represents the individual tiddlers that are packaged into the plugin.

During the boot process of a ~TiddlyWiki 5 or later when importing a plugin into a ~TiddlyWiki 5 plugins automatically get unpacked. That means that the tiddlers packed into a plugin are unpacked into individual ''shadow tiddlers''.

[[Shadow tiddlers|Shadow Tiddler]] cannot be changed, but they can be overwritten simply by creating a new tiddler with the same title. Unfortunately, there isn't yet an offical term for such a tiddler that overwrites a shadow tiddler. In this documentation I'll use the term [[foreground tiddler|Foreground Tiddler]] instead when refering to a tiddler (in the foreground) for which a shadow tiddler exists.

!Packaging

Basically, there are two ways to package plugins:

@@.wide
# inside the web browser from the JavaScript console. I won't further detail this process as I consider the //Third Flow// process to be much easier in comparism.

# from the command line running a ~TiddlyWiki 5 instance under the control of Node.js and using the [[--packplugin|packplugin Command]] command that comes with the //Third Flow// plugin. Typically, you will call this command during the release phase from your ~TiddlyWiki [[release edition]].
