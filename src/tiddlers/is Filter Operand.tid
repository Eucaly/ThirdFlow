title: is Filter Operand
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!Abstract

The //operands// to the `is` filter //operator// are easily extensible through [[modules|Module]] with a `module-type` of `isfilteroperator` (sic!). Now this <<tw5>> core architecture really //is// sweet, isn't it?!

The <<tf>> plugin brings in this:

<<list-links filter:"[tag[is Filter Operand]]">>

!Note Bene

For some reason unknown to us the operands of the `is` filter operator are tagged as `isfilteroperator` and not ~~`isfilteroperand`~~ as someone may expect. Any hey, //we// didn't came up with the operator-operand thingy.
